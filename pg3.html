    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We're a passionate team of students united by a shared love for robotics, technology, and innovation. The KMHS Robotics Club was founded on the belief that with the right support, anyone regardless of experience can thrive in STEM.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Our club offers a hands-on, team-oriented space where members explore every aspect of robotics: design, programming, electronics, and mechanical engineering. Whether you're just starting out or already building complex systems, there's a place for you here.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Through collaborative projects, workshops, and upcoming competitions, we help each other develop real-world problem-solving and engineering skills. We're not just building robots—we're building confidence, leadership, and future careers.</p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>As we grow, we're preparing to enter regional and national competitions, showcasing our skills and unlocking scholarships and new opportunities. But above all, we’re here to support each other, have fun, and push the limits of what we can achieve together.</p>
